## My process

Until now i am just learning web development, by now i just know html and css, not css frameworks, not css pre/post processores, not Javascript, not Js frameworks.

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

doing this challenge i learned how set two or more background images to any element.

```css
#flowing {
    background: url(images/bg-section-bottom-mobile-1.svg) 0px 0px no-repeat, url(images/bg-section-top-mobile-2.svg)
            0px 100% no-repeat;
}
```

### Continued development

Even if to me is more complex design mobile first, i preffer to continue develop of this way.
By now in short time, my next skills to develop are css grid, css frameworks (boostrap or tailwind), css pre-preocessor (sass), css post-processors (postcss), pure Javascript, typescript and css-framework (angular).
